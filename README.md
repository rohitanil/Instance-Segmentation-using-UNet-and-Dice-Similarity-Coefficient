# Instance-Segmentation-using-UNet-and-Dice-Similarity-Coefficient

Develop a deep learning model for identifying cell nuclei from histology images. The model should have the ability to generalize across a variety of lighting conditions,cell types, magnifications etc. The generated mask should have the same size as that of the corresponding raw image.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
